# ðŸ’« About Me
Hi, my name is Prateek Maurya. 
I'm a 15 year old programmer from India. 
I'm fascinated by embedded systems, low level coding, microcontroller dev, blockchain technology, operating systems as well as console homebrew and custom firmwares.
Most of the things I develop are open source and available for free for everyone to use here on my GitHub page.

Besides programming, I love playing football, Crypto Trading and listening sad songs (as you might have assumed already).

Don't know why but i have âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ addiction with a person whose name contains 'AA' or 'AAA'.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a software
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about WEB 3.0 and solidity
